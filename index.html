    Who am I?

    Ok, so let's be honest this is really...

    ## <span class="red">*</span> Another opinionated talk about a framework to build web services

    ---

    <span class="large">![Thumbs Down](thumbsdown.gif)</span>

    ##But that's okay!
    ##New things are shiny and fun!

    # So what is Dropwizard?

    ![Dropwizard logo](dropwizard-hat.png)

    ---

    class: center, middle

    ## Dropwizard is a Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services.
    #### - The Dropwizard website

    ### In other words...

    ---

    class: center, middle

    <span class="large">![Yawn](yawn.gif)</span>

    ???

    We're used to this right?

    A Framework promising to solve your problems

    easier better faster

    I mean really, we've seen this a million times before

    So what makes Dropwizard different?

    Nothing.

    ### Dropwizard isn't glamorous, it's designed to help you get things done

    ???

    And not only done, but production ready done

    ---

    # The core ingedients

    * Embedded Jetty
    * REST via Jersey with JAX-RS annotations
    * Jackson for JSON
    * Built in Metrics
    * Logging via slf4j and Logback

    ???

    Jetty - no container, fast

    Jersey - simple resource definitions next to your code

    Jackson - basically THE json library on the jvm

    Metrics - know what your service is doing, both timing and usage

    Logging - battle tested, fast

    ---

    # Other niceties

    * Guava
    * Hibernate Validator
    * JodaTime
    * Freemarker / Mustache templates
    * Apache HttpClient
    * Testable

    ???

    I know that I said that this talk was opinionated,
    but did I mention that Dropwizard is opinionated too?

    But don't worry, most things are swappable, use what you want

    ---

    # More than an HTTP server

    * Admin interface
      * Healthchecks
      * Metrics
      * Thread dumps
      * Tasks
    * Commands
    * Managed Objects
    * Environments

    ???

    Admin interface

    Healthchecks - imperative to keep verify your app is up and running

    Metrics - endpoint to see current metric stats

    Thread dumps - get it via http

    Tasks - http accessible routes not exposed to public routes

    Commands - command line commands

    Managed Objects - control startup / shutdown is tricky

    Environments - think setting up different services per environment

    #Let's build something!

    ie going to show building a cool basic app

    ### Now for the very opinionated part of the talk

    # Why not J2EE?

    * Do you really need all the features of J2EE?
    * Classloader problems, Permgen issues
    * Shared non-isolated resources (CPU, memory)
    * NOT ops friendly
    * You don't need a container to run a web server

    ???

    I kid though, J2EE has it's place, but for 95% of the problems out there
    it's overkill and the overhead (both performance and development wise)
    just isn't worth it

    These days the game has changed, it's about running one app on a cloud instance
    and adding more instances instead of beefing up your server

    ---

    # Why Dropwizard?

    * Easy development
    * Easy deployment
    * Production ready
    * Lightweight
    * Ops ready

    ???

    Easy development - no special setup, most things are pojos, easy to test

    Easy deployment - Build an uber jar, run it, no app server

    Production ready - all the pieces you need to feel good about running in production

    Lightweight - a lot of the hype around nodejs and other languages is that
    they're lightweight and fast

    Ops ready - everything operations needs to keep your app running is built in
    don't have an ops team? then it's all the things YOU need to keep your app running
